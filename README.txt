First of all, the code seems to be written in a perfect functional manner with a clear separation by default. There is no special need to refactor that because it is already written in a good way. However, I put my love and effort to make it more improved and well-structured. Here are some specific observations:

What's good about the code:

- The code is well-structured and easy to read. Each method has a clear purpose and the code is nicely formatted, making it easy to follow.
- The code is highly modular, which makes it easy to test and maintain.
- The controller uses dependency injection to provide an instance of the BookingRepository to each method that needs it.
- The code follows OOP principles.

What could be improved:

- The code does not consistently follow recommended coding standards. That's why it needs to be improved for better readability and structure.
- Some code has been written in an old way that needs to be improved.
- The code has some extra statements and conditions that don't need to be here in the code.
- The code not using the operators that need to be used in the code like ternary operators, and coalescing operators.
- There are some lines of code that are long, which could be written in a short and easy way.

The comments of refactored code changes are added at the start of each function that is refactored in the files that are mandatory to complete the task:
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and modular, which is a good thing. However, there are some minor improvements that could be made to follow coding standards and improve readability.
